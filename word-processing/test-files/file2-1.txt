A   knowledge     and	   appreciation of   interrelationship between          places and events 
is essential if we  are to make       informed decisions  about their       place in the 
                       world   community.                         Therefore, 
the  extent of basic geographic and historical literacy may play crucial role in decision 
making in global international markets.
